# community-addressing

The Community Addressing application is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a JavaScript application that allows the general public to contribute missing site address locations and provide citizen contact information for current addresses.  This interactive web application includes a simple tool to review existing addresses and submit new address and contact information.
