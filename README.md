# address-crowdsourcing
(previously named community-addressing)

The Address Crowdsourcing application (previously named Community Addressing) is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that allows the general public to contribute missing site address locations and provide citizen contact information for current addresses.  This interactive web application includes a simple tool to review existing addresses and submit new address and contact information.

The application name change happened at the February 2015 release.
